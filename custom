A resume is a brief, formal document created by job seekers to showcase their professional qualifications, including work experience, education, skills, and accomplishments, to potential employers. It acts as a professional snapshot, providing a tailored overview of relevant information designed to secure a job interview. The document is typically one to two pages long and includes sections like contact information, a professional summary, work history, education, and a list of skills.
